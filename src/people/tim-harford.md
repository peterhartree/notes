# Tim Harford
Outstanding public intellectual, educator, storyteller.

Tim has helped me become more statistically literate, his constant de-bunking of newspaper claims and curious exploration of interesting questions has helped tune my instincts for what good and bad statistical reasoning looks like.

Tim is one of several figures that helped me recognise that consuming daily news actively hinders your understanding of the world. He has helped me understand the modern economy, cautionary tales

With More or Less, he has performed a heroic public service with skill and charm for more than a decade. 

Places to start:
* [50 Things]
* [Cautionary Tales]
* [More or Less]

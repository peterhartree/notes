# Tim Harford
Tim has helped me understand the modern economy, in particular to appreciate the power of market mechanisms as a means of co-ordination and resource allocation.

With More or Less, his radio show, he has performed a heroic public service with wit and charm for more than a decade, patiently de-bunking false or misleading claims made in the public sphere by journalists, politicians, activists and academics. His loyal listeners are so entertained that they barely notice as he tunes their instincts for critical thinking and statistical reasoning with aplomb. 

Tim is one of several figures that helped me recognise that reading the news every day makes your understanding of the world worse, not better. 

Heâ€™s also told me some great cautionary tales.

# Tim Harford
Outstanding public intellectual, educator, storyteller.

Tim has helped me understand the modern economy, in particular to appreciate the miracle of market pricing.

His patient investigation of implausible claims and interesting questions has helped tune my instincts for what good and bad statistical reasoning looks like. With More or Less, he has performed a heroic public service with skill and charm for more than a decade, patiently de-bunking implausible claims made in the public sphere by journalists, politicians, activists and academics.

Tim is one of several figures that helped me recognise that consuming daily news actively impairs your understanding of the world. 

Heâ€™s also told me some great cautionary tales.

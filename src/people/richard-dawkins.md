[The Selfish Gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene) underplays the human capacity for co-operation, and now seems too hard on theories that posit [multi-level selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_selection#Multilevel_selection_theory). But the following line remains true, and unforgettable:

> We are survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. 

I remember where I was when I read this for the first time. It was one of my early viewquakes.

If I were to rework this, I’d cut the word “selfish”, and emphasise the physical aspect of the process: 

> We are survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed by the forces of nature to preserve the self-replicating molecules known as genes.

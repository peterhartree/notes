# David Runciman
Until recently, everything I knew about Jeremy Bentham was based on secondary sources [1]. David Runciman’s [lecture on Bentham](https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/history-of-ideas-series-two) made me go and read [The Principles of Morals and Legislation](https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/bentham1780.pdf) first hand.

Runciman thinks that Bentham’s reputation as a maybe-autistic philistine is based on a massive misreading. Runciman thinks the Principle of Utility was never intended to be The True And Comprehensive Theory of Value, but rather “just” to serve as a firm foundation for political order. That is to say: a practical principle that enough people can agree on.

This way of reading Bentham makes him seem reasonable and wise—from “crazy genius”, to just, genius. And it reminds me of a move I’ve personally made, which 80,000 Hours has made, which Tyler Cowen has made, which perhaps most non-crazy secular moral thinkers make, in light of [moral uncertainty](https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/moral-uncertainty/). Namely: you stop thinking that a commitment to ambitious reformist action could only be justified _after_ you’ve developed a robust and complete moral theory. You recognise that such a theory will elude us for the foreseeable future, and yet we must act now. And so: one way to square this circle is to act on principles that seem likely to capture at least _part_ of whatever the True And Comprehensive Theory of Value turns out to be. If a large number of people can agree on part of the story, that’s already enough to make things much, much better [2].

Towards the end of an interview with Dan Snow, David gives a pessimistic monologue about oppression and _ressentiment_, but then speaks movingly about Bentham:

> I prefer Bentham to Mill, partly because he gets a worse press. He’s supposed to be this automaton, pleasure machine guy but actually he had a heart of gold. The whole project was just about: there’s too much suffering in the damn world. He was partly responding to a society in which people were still being executed for what was called sodomy, I mean you could be executed for being gay. And Bentham says the great advantage of utilitarianism, whatever else you might think about it, is that there is no way, on the utilitarian calculus, that you can do that. So who cares what else is wrong with it, my god we could save people. So there is that, the ability to identify the obvious injustices. I don’t think Bentham has solutions, I think what Bentham has is a *means* of saying: this *cannot* go on any longer, you can’t not let people vote, you can’t execute people for these crimes, you can’t run a state on the basis of cruelty, and what you should do in place of cruelty well who cares, just don’t be cruel.

I’ve uploaded a 4 minute segment that includes this moment [here](https://podcasts-2.feedpress.com/22275/runciman-on-bentham.mp3), I recommend it.

This is just one of many things I’ve learnt from Runciman’s fantastic [History of Ideas](https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com/history-of-ideas-series-two) series. His other show, [Talking Politics](https://www.talkingpoliticspodcast.com) is also great. Some of the episodes I’ve posted to The Valmy:

* [Bentham on Pleasure](https://thevalmy.com/#49)
* [Butler on Machines](https://thevalmy.com/48)
* [Democracy for Young People](https://thevalmy.com/35)
* [Wollstonecraft on Sexual Politics](https://thevalmy.com/10)
* [Hobbes on the State](https://thevalmy.com/9)

Maybe I should read some of his books!

[1] With [one exception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham#Death_and_the_auto-icon).

[2] A natural worry: what if people take the partial story to be the full story? Clearly, this can have bad consequences—especially if those people happen to be creating powerful systems that optimise for the partial story. The general failure mode of “optimising too hard for the wrong thing” seems widespread, and very costly. Is the Principle of Utility underrated or overrated by liberal institutions at this point? I hope to write on this anon.

# Nick Bostrom
Bostrom convinced me that reducing catastrophic and existential risks should be among our top global priorities. He also originated or developed many other ideas I consider important, such as transhumanism, information hazards, the unilateralist curse and the parliamentary approach to moral uncertainty.  

In his biography, he articulates a thought that has troubled me since my mid-teens:

> I believe it is likely that we are overlooking one or more crucial considerations: ideas or arguments that might plausibly reveal the need for not just some minor course adjustment in our endeavours but a major change of direction or priority. If we have overlooked even just one such crucial consideration, then all our best efforts might be for naughtâ€”or they might even be making things worse. 

Bostrom has dedicated his career to helping us discover more crucial considerations for the future or humanity. I wish more of our best intellectuals would think in similarly ambitious terms.

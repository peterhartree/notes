# Julia Galef
Julia Galef is a public intellectual with strong ties to the [rationality community](https://www.lesswrong.com/).

Her [podcast](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/) is great (despite the dorky branding). Some of my favourites:

*  [RS141: Dan Sperber on “The Argumentative Theory of reason”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs141-dan-sperber-on-the-argumentative-theory-of-reason.html) 
*  [RS 176 - Jason Brennan on “Against democracy”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-176-jason-brennan-on-against-democracy.html) 
* [RS 232 - Tyler Cowen on “Defending big business against its critics”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-232-tyler-cowen-on-defending-big-business-against-its-cri.html) 
*  [RS 190 - Amanda Askell on “Pascal’s Wager and other low risks with high stakes”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-190-amanda-askell-on-pascals-wager-and-other-low-risks-wi.html) 
*  [RS 216 - Diana Fleischman on “Being a transhumanist evolutionary psychologist”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-216-diana-fleischman-on-being-a-transhumanist-evolutionar.html) 
*  [RS 197 - Doug Hubbard on “Why people think some things can’t be quantified (and why they’re wrong)”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-197-doug-hubbard-on-why-people-think-some-things-cant-be.html) 
*  [RS 236 - Alex Tabarrok on “Why are the Prices So D*mn High?”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-236-alex-tabarrok-on-why-are-the-prices-so-dmn-high.html) 
*  [RS 240 - David Manheim on “Goodhart’s Law and why metrics fail”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-240-david-manheim-on-goodharts-law-and-why-metrics-fail.html) 
*  [Episode 252: Understanding moral disagreements (Jonathan Haidt)](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/episode-252-understanding-moral-disagreements-jonathan-haidt.html) 
* [RS135 - Robin Hanson on: “Most human behavior is signaling”](http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs135-robin-hanson-on-most-human-behavior-is-signaling.html) 

Like [Tyler Cowen](/people/tyler-cowen.md), she’s good at helping us learn to think better. Her style is quite different from his, though—I hope to write more about this soon.

She has a book due out soon, which will promote some of the best norms associated with the rationality community. Her [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfRC8ZgBXZw) at The Long Now Foundation is a good preview.

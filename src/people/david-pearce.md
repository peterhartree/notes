# David Pearce
TESTING 	David Pearce takes the problem of suffering seriously. In 1995 he published The Hedonistic Imperative, a manifesto that outlines a vision of life based on information-sensitive gradients of bliss. Which is to say: a vision of life free from involuntary suffering, but still containing a range of hedonic experience which serves to motivate action. While our Darwinian brains operate on a range of +10 to -10 (or perhaps more like +5 to -20), Pearce suggests we could plausibly engineer transhuman minds to run on a range of +10 to +100, where the least good conscious experiences are akin to what we call peak experiences today.

Sounds good, non? Sadly, most people’s first reaction is “sounds crazy”.

/*Pearce starts from something like the basic Buddhist imperative—the end of suffering—and combines this with a sense of the technological possibilities of the coming centuries. This yields an argument for the feasibility and desirability of engineering our way towards eradicating all forms of involuntary suffering from planet earth (and, hopefully, our future light cone).*/

I first encountered Pearce during my undergraduate degree. Like many people, my initial reaction was a mixture of interest and suspicion, and I largely waved him away as a depressive crank. But over the past decade, I’ve read most of his work, and he is now one of the thinkers I most admire.

His intellectual conscience and awareness of suffering leads him to a dark take on life on earth so far. “Darwinian hellscape” sums it up, and he is speaking mildly. I tend to agree with the empirical claim, that the ratio of negative to positive experiences on earth to date is probably worse than 99:1 (though writing this I realise that I’d like to hear the steelman for a cheerier view). If you combine this observation with any axiology that places sensible weights on positive and negative conscious experience, you’ll end up with a pretty dark view of how things have been so far. Possibly the realisation of non-hedonistic values could redeem things somewhat, but you’ll need rather a lot of operas and excellence and loving relationships to meaningfully tip the scales. The realisation of this empirical and moral truth is extremely disturbing, the kind of thing that causes loss of faith, sometimes even mental breakdown or suicide. Unsurprisingly, we don’t talk about this much, and our social narratives and entertainment are mostly geared towards obscuring this insight. Pearce has developed a darkly amusing alternative vocabulary aimed at shaking people out of their complacent sense that the status quo is good, or at least okay: most humans are “fanatical life lovers”, their vision obscured by “rose tinting Darwinian malware”, natural conception is “genetic crapshoot” and so on.

Nietzsche: how much truth can you bear?

So that’s the bad news. The good news, according to Pearce, is that with modern technology we are finally in a position to chart a roadmap to a much better world. 

I don’t have the scientific understanding to assess Pearce’s empirical claims, but he’s at least right in spirit: at current margins, we should be pushing far far harder towards the eradication of involuntary suffering. I agree with him that it’s hard to avoid the suspicion that the main reasons we don’t are a naive and complacent status quo bias. It is a difficult balance: when the truth is this disturbing, it is perfectly understandable and perhaps pragmatically essential to avoid a devastating collision, not least due to the risk that dwelling on such truths leads to incurable pessimism or despair. But Pearce would say, and I tend to agree, that influential elites tend to err too much on the side of complacent obliviousness, and would do well to cultivate a greater sense of the urgency of improvement. Most elites fail to fully appreciate how exceptional they are, and many underplay the amount of abject pointless suffering that plagues even their lives, telling stories whose allegedly redemptive qualities simply do not stand up to a modicum of intellectual scrutiny (“caring for my demented mother taught me the value of compassion”, “the death of my brother helped me appreciate that life is a gift”) if the claim is that the negative experience was somehow “worth it” for the upside. Yes, strong people usually find a way to experience terrible events as “not all bad”, but we should not forget that they usually remain stubbornly awful, on net.

I have a fairly strong culturally conservative instinct myself, and all sorts of worries about the practical implementation of radical visions. Obviously, such an agenda must be pursued with extreme caution and care. But there’s nothing objectionable about radical visions per se, and having chewed over this one for a decade I now hope that a popularised version of his picture becomes widely adopted. 

Engaging with Pearce is complicated by the fact that he defends negative utilitarianism or “suffering focussed ethics”. On this unpopular view, the eradication of suffering is the only good, and no amount of pleasure will be sufficient compensation for a modicum of involuntary suffering. This axiology is the reason Pearce has to speak in terms of eradicating involuntary suffering rather than just massively reducing it, and why he mostly focussed on the negative aspect of the imperative (abolish suffering). While I can see the case for suffering focussed ethics (I at least share the prioritarian instinct), I don’t endorse it, and I tend to think (as Pearce does) that axiology is significantly a function of psychological type.

As Pearce is keen to stress, the future belongs to the live lovers, and even the most cheerful axiologies tend to agree that the eradication or at least minimisation of involuntary suffering is an important goal. Pearce has helped me see how urgent this problem is, and how great an improvement we could achieve with current and future technologies, if only we would try.

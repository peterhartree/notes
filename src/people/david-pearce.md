# David Pearce
David Pearce takes the problem of suffering seriously. He’s also a principled eccentric, who does not mind being seen as a weirdo.

In 1995 David published _The Hedonistic Imperative_, a manifesto that outlines a vision of life based on “information-sensitive gradients of bliss”. That’s to say: a vision of life free from involuntary suffering, but still containing a range of emotional experiences which serve to motivate action. While our Darwinian brains operate on a range of (say) +5 to -20, Pearce suggests we could one day engineer minds that run on a range of +10 to +100, where the least good conscious experiences are better than what we call peak experiences today.

Sounds good, non? Sadly, most people’s first reaction is: “sounds crazy”. That was certainly my reaction, when I first read Pearce, and my impulse was to dismiss him as a depressive crank. But over the past decade, I’ve read most of his work, and he is now a thinker I greatly admire.

Pearce’s intellectual conscience and awareness of suffering leads him to a dark take on life on earth so far. “Darwinian hellscape” is his polite description for the status quo. I’m unsure, but I tend to agree with the empirical claim, that the ratio of negative to positive experiences [1] on earth to date is probably worse than 90:1 (I’d like to hear the steelman for a cheerier view). If you combine this claim with any theory of value that places sensible weights on positive and negative experiences, you’ll end up with a pretty grim view of how things have been so far. Possibly the realisation of non-experiential values could redeem things somewhat, but you’ll need rather a lot of operas and excellence and loving relationships to tip the scales into the black.

Thinking about this empirical and moral possibility is very disturbing, the kind of thing that causes loss of faith, sometimes even mental breakdown or suicide. Unsurprisingly, we don’t talk about it much, and our social narratives and entertainment are geared towards obscuring this thought. Pearce has developed an amusing alternative vocabulary aimed at shaking people out of a complacent sense that the status quo is good, or at least okay: most humans are “fanatical life lovers”, their vision obscured by “rose tinting Darwinian malware”, natural conception is “genetic crapshoot” and so on.

So that’s the bad news. The good news, according to Pearce, is that with modern technology we can finally see a path to a much better world.

I don’t have the scientific knowledge to assess Pearce’s empirical claims about “volume knobs” for physical pain and the genetic determination of hedonic set point. But I’m fairly sure that he’s at least right in spirit: at current margins, we should be pushing much much harder towards using technology to eradicate involuntary suffering. 

Why aren’t we? Pearce would say that a naive and complacent status quo bias is a big part of the answer; I’m inclined to agree [2]. It is a difficult balance: if the truth is this disturbing, it is understandable and perhaps pragmatically valuable to avoid this recognition, on pain of incurable pessimism or despair. But Pearce would say, and I tend to agree, that powerful elites usually err on the side of complacent obliviousness, and would do well to cultivate a greater sense of the urgency of improvement—a sense that while there is much that is good, there is also much that is utterly unacceptable. I worry that elites often fail to fully appreciate how exceptional they are. Many underplay the amount of involuntary suffering that plagues even their lives, telling stories whose allegedly redemptive qualities would not stand up to a hint of intellectual scrutiny (“caring for my demented parent taught me the value of family”, “the death of my brother helped me appreciate that life is a gift”) if the claim is that the terrible experience was somehow “worth it”. Yes, strong people usually find a way to narrativise terrible events as “not all bad”, but we should not forget that they usually remain stubbornly awful, on net. Abject involuntary suffering is not to be welcomed.

Personally, I have a fairly strong conservative instinct in thought and action, although this has weakened over time. I see many reasons to worry about the practical implementation of radical visions. Obviously, such agendas should be pursued with extreme caution and care. But there’s nothing objectionable about radical visions _per se_, and having chewed over the transhumanist picture for a decade I‘m now on the brink of becoming a strong advocate [3]. 

Reading Pearce is complicated by the fact that he defends “negative utilitarianism”, sometimes known as “suffering-focussed ethics”. On this view, the eradication of suffering is the only good, and no amount of pleasure will be sufficient compensation for even the smallest amount of involuntary suffering. Though I start with some prioritarian intuitions and Buddhist sympathies, I find this theory of value implausible. The best possible worlds would contain no suffering, but the presence of suffering in a world does not mean it would have been better for that world never to have been.

With Nietzsche, I rather suspect that our theories of value are deeply shaped by our psychological type. To his credit, Pearce has expressed significant credence in this possibility, I think to the extent of saying that if his theory of value is wrong, psychological factors are the most likely reason.

Pearce’s commitment to negative utilitarianism is the reason that he has to speak in terms of _totally eradicating_ involuntary suffering rather than just massively reducing it, and why he mostly focusses on the negative aspect of the imperative (abolish suffering). His attempts to describe a wonderful “triple S” future of “super-intelligence, super-longevity and super-happiness” sometimes sound a bit half-hearted. A transhumanist with a more [[cheerful axiology]] might be able to paint a more appealing picture. So I’m excited for Anders Sandberg’s forthcoming book.

As Pearce is keen to stress, the future belongs to the live lovers, and even the most cheerful axiologies agree that the reduction of involuntary suffering is an important goal. Pearce has helped me keep in mind how urgent this problem is, and how much we could achieve with current and future technologies, if only we had the boldness of vision to try.

[1] An experience is positive if an informed and rational experiencer would choose to have the experience over unconsciousness. 

[2] I take Bostrom and Ord’s “[reversal test](https://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/statusquo.pdf)” to have exposed extreme status quo bias in bioethical discourse. Has anyone written a strong rebuttal to this paper?

[3] Transhumanism is short on attractive, non-weirdo advocates. Elon Musk is probably the best candidate, perhaps he and Grimes can develop a scalable transhuman aesthetic. Anders Sandberg is a charming weirdo. Liv Boree is an attractive former poker star who could pass for a normie. Personally I find Nick Bostrom very funny and oddly charismatic (“We already have skin enhancers... clothing”), but I guess this is a minority view. Who am I missing?

# Holden Karnofsky
Holden runs the [Open Philanthropy Project](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/), a philanthropic foundation. 

I particularly admire Holden for the intellectual culture he promotes at Open Philanthropy, and within the effective altruism community more broadly. Two blog posts that give a flavour: 

* [Sequence Thinking vs Cluster Thinking](https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/).  
* [Update on Cause Prioritization at Open Philanthropy](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy) 

Through his leadership of Open Philanthropy, his past work at GiveWell and his board seat at OpenAI, he seems on course to make an exceptional contribution. 

For more, see his [80,000 Hours interview](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/holden-karnofsky-open-philanthropy/), and his more recent [Ask Me Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMbpPoz9hWQ).

_The Open Philanthropy Project is a major donor to 80,000 Hours, where I work, as well as other groups and individuals in the effective altruism community._

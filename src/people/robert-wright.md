# Robert Wright
I read The Moral Animal in my mid-teens. For me it was a great introduction to evolutionary psychology and the naturalistic perspective which understands the origins of moral behaviour in terms of adaptations that enable mutually beneficial co-operation between individuals, and that enable some groups to reap zero sum benefits over others.

Some years later I read Nonzero. If I remember correctly, this book was my introduction to the idea that managing increasingly powerful and democratised technology is among the most important challenges of the 21st century.

In my early twenties I took his “Buddhism and Modern Psychology” MOOC, and I read “Why Buddhism is True” shortly after it came out. Discussing his interest in Buddhism, I once heard Wright say that after The Moral Animal, he felt like he had “seen the truth but not the way”. I had a similar experience. Wright’s work, combined with that of Sam Harris and Headspace Andy, helped motivate me to start a daily meditation practice, and eventually convinced me to try a silent retreat (“extreme sports for the mind”). I found the retreat experience extremely valuable and now do them annually.

Wright has been a pioneer of video blogging and podcasting since XXXX. I’ve enjoyed countless interviews on his website—Strawson on pansychism comes to mind, as does Cowen and Singer.

Anecdotally, it seems as though Robert Wright’s work was an important early influence for many key figures in the rationalist and effective altruism communities. 

I am inspired by Wright’s commitment to worldly intellectual life and the quiet sense of moral / religious urgency that pervades it. I also appreciate his dry, absurdist humour.

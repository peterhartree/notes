# Robert Wright
I read The Moral Animal in my mid-teens. It was a great introduction to evolutionary psychology and the moral naturalism. The naturalist explains the origin of moral behaviour in terms of evolutionary adaptations that enable mutually beneficial co-operation between individuals, and that enable some groups to reap zero-sum benefits over others.

Some years later I read Nonzero. The book was among my first exposures to the idea that managing risks from increasingly powerful and democratised technological capabilities is among the most important challenges of the 21st century.

In my early twenties I took Wright’s “Buddhism and Modern Psychology” MOOC, and I read “Why Buddhism is True” shortly after it came out. Discussing his interest in Buddhism, I once heard Wright say that after The Moral Animal, he felt like he had “seen the truth but not the way”. I had a similar experience. Wright’s work, combined with that of Sam Harris and Headspace Andy, helped cause me to start a daily meditation practice, and eventually convinced me to try a silent retreat (“extreme sports for the mind”). I found the retreat experience extremely valuable and now do them annually.

Wright has been a pioneer of video blogging and podcasting since the mid 2000s. I’ve enjoyed countless interviews on his website—Strawson on pansychism comes to mind, as does Cowen and Singer.

Anecdotally, it seems as though Robert Wright’s work was an important early influence for many key figures in the rationalist and effective altruism communities. 

I’m inspired by Wright’s commitment to worldly intellectual life and the quiet sense of moral / religious urgency that pervades it. I also appreciate his dry humour.

* What are better jumping off points for Robert Wright? One of his Paul Bloom interviews? The Nonzero TED talk? I’d like to hear some of his moral animal book talks…

# Tyler Cowen
Tyler may be my favourite example of the “worldly intellectual”. 

Several aspects of Tyler’s style (contrarianism; marginalism; incomplete elaboration) are an expression of a core belief: everyone is overconfident about everything. 

Here’s Tyler describing Stubborn Attachments, his most philosophical book:

> People always think they’re more right on average than they are. This is true of everyone. If it’s true of everyone it has to be true of me, so I wanted to build a set of arguments that in some way were robust to me being wrong most of the time, and that’s hard to do. If you’re wrong most of the time, your arguments are wrong most of the time. But is there some meta-level where there’s a claim you can make that is taking that into account in some way.

Tyler’s interviewing style is widely acclaimed. His “underrated or overrated” segment may still be somewhat underrated. To me, it is about teaching us how to think: the fertility of marginal thinking, the difficulty of appropriate calibration, the gains from allowing ourselves to seek less-than-timeless truths.

Stubborn Attachments might be a masterpiece, I’m not sure yet. My summary: we tend to be too focussed on wealth distribution, and not enough on wealth creation. Wealth is a necessary, nearly sufficient condition for realising the plurality of values people care about [1]. If you can increase the long run sustainable rate of wealth creation, compounding generates staggering differences in average wealth a few decades down the line. This means the positive consequences of interventions that improve the growth rate dwarf those of nearly all interventions that don’t improve the growth rate.

With this in mind, it seems like a good starting maxim is: “maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth”. We should make some adjustments away from this (e.g. we can maintain an almost absolute commitment to basic human rights, e.g. “don’t murder”, “don’t torture”) but we should keep in mind just how incredibly expensive such deviations are for future people. This implies we should try much harder than we do to minimise the deviation—you can’t casually throw in your favourite causes, or some feel-good concessions to the here and now, it really is just basic human rights and, well…  it’s not clear what else might be above the bar.

One nice property of this maxim is that it somewhat relaxes the need to agree on what is valuable before we collaborate. On a sufficiently long time horizon, the “rising tide lifts all boats” argument really does seem to work. Hardline longtermism is unsettling insofar as it conflicts with the prioritarian intuition that says we should focus on helping people in the here and now. Tyler recognises this, but thinks that at this point, the burden of proof is on those who argue for a non-zero discount rate for welfare. A zero rate of discount should be our working assumption, and we should have the courage of conviction to act on this. It is virtuous to be haunted by the tragedy of these tradeoffs, but it is not virtuous to think that patently terrible trades can be justified by strength of feeling alone [2]. 

Tyler puts less emphasis on sustainability / stability / safety than key figures in the effective altruism movement. One crux seems to be a different view about what messages should be blasted into the public sphere. Tyler seems to agree we should pile more resources into safety at current margins. But I think he thinks that most people should focus on maximising rate of economic growth, and only a minority should go into safety. Further: it might be very bad if safety concerns go too mainstream, because this could contribute to risk aversion in the culture which… you guessed it…. would be a drag on long-run economic growth. 

There’s probably also a deeper crux, though—Tyler seems to be more confident than some people that life on earth has only centuries to go, and seems to think it’s not worth betting heavily on the small probability we make it to the stars [4]. 

I’d like to understand more about Tyler’s views on the prospect of transformative AI, and I also want to hear him speak or write about Nietzsche. The latter has almost no mentions on his blog, despite Tyler being among the planet’s most prolific readers. 

This entry has focussed on his worldview, but Tyler’s “real world” influence over the past decade or two strikes me as fairly staggering. To take one example: my impression is that Tyler’s efforts against COVID-19 have saved thousands of lives and millions of dollars—by speeding up information transmission via his blog, and speeding up grantmaking via [Fast Grants](https://fastgrants.org). I would not be shocked if the true figures were millions and billions, respectively, though doling out counterfactual credits is tricky. 

I hope to write more on Tyler’s work soon.

[1] I’m fuzzy on what Tyler means by “wealth” and what the relationship between “wealth” and “value” is supposed to be. @TODO

[2] I’m not aware of strong consequentialist arguments for a non-zero discount rate for welfare. Rather remarkably, this seems like an area of moral philosophy that is pretty settled [3]. It is hard, to paraphrase Rob, to seem sensible if you equivocate between a single ancient Egyptian and millions of people alive today. If one wants to fudge in some more weighting for the current generation, I think the way to do it would be to flesh out the deontological constraints. Tyler is deliberately vague on where our bar should be, e.g. he says we should spend less on the elderly, but does not give detail. To some extent, this strategic vagueness is something I admire about Tyler. One cool thing about “thinking on the margin” is that it gives the philosophically inclined an important reminder: most of the time, you actually don’t need to know exactly where you want to end up, just which direction seems robustly good to move in.  

[3] Hmm… this is actually so surprising … am I missing something here? IIRC GPI has looked into this and there was that Mogensen paper, but I’m fairly sure that was a non-consequentialist argument @TODO. What happens if one takes a broader definition of “serious moral philosophy”? I can’t think of (what I’d take to be) 2nd or 3rd tier thinkers who’ve argued for this… I guess the best candidate might be the “rational arguments are just rationalisations of power” crowd.

[4] I am keen to figure out why. A few ideas:

* Distrust of Pascal’s Wager type arguments.
* Some of his “cone of value” and “incommensurability” comments suggest he thinks that we can’t intelligibly talk about the value of a world containing our posthuman descendants.
* There’s actually not a substantive disagreement, just a disagreement about what it’s useful to say.

Tyler is an accomplished educator, and a compelling example of the “worldly academic”. He has helped me learn about economics and how to think.

> Uncertainty quote

I take overconfidence to be among Tyler’s deepest fears, and I see him constantly trying to hedge against this, and to remind others that they should be more uncertain. This is part of the rationale for his contrarian style, and the “hard to pin down” mode of communication he sometimes employs.

Tyler’s interviewing style is widely acclaimed. I think his “underrated or overrated” segment may still be somewhat underrated, though. I see it as part of his attempt to embody and teach the impulse to “think on the margin”.

Stubborn Attachments might be a masterpiece, in any case I suspect it is currently quite underrated in several circles that should know better. My summary: philosophers have focussed too much on wealth distribution, and not enough on wealth creation. Wealth is a necessary but not quite sufficient condition for the realisation of moral value. If you can increase the sustainable rate of wealth creation, compounding means that the long run positive effects are extremely large, dwarfing the goodness of most/all interventions that don’t target the growth rate (e.g. interventions that change the distribution of wealth that are either neutral or negative for growth rate). 

- illustration?

So, a good starting maxim is “maximise the rate of sustainable economic growth”. We should make some adjustments away from this (e.g. don’t murder, don’t torture) but we should keep in mind just how incredibly expensive such deviations are for future people, which implies trying hard to minimise the deviation. One nice feature of this maxim is that you don’t have to solve axiology, you can just trust that more wealth means more realisation of a plurality of values, and hope the philosophers get their act together in the future.

Tyler puts less emphasis on safety than key figures in the effective altruism movement. My impression is one significant crux is a different view about “what it’s useful to emphasise”. That’s to say, I think he basically agrees we should pile more into safety at current margins. But I think he thinks that this is not the ideal message to blast at the world: most people should focus on maximising rate of economic growth, only a minority should go into safety, and it might be very bad if safety concerns go very mainstream. There’s probably also some deeper disagreement, though—Tyler seems to think life on earth has only centuries to go, and seems to think it’s not worth betting heavily on the small probability we make it to the stars.

I’d like to know more about Tyler’s views on the prospect of transformative AI, and I also want to hear him speak or write about Nietzsche. The latter has almost no mentions on his blog, despite Tyler being among the planet’s most prolific readers.

As a lower bound, my impression is that Tyler’s efforts in the fight against COVID-19 have saved thousands of lives and millions of dollars—by speeding up information transmission via his blog, and speeding up grantmaking via Fast Grants. I would not be shocked if the true figures were millions and billions, respectively, though doling out counterfactual credits is a tricky business.

I’ve spent many days with Tyler over the past couple years and I hope to write more on his work soon.

> Certainly there may be other means of finding oneself, or coming to oneself out of the bewilderment in which one usually wanders as in a dark cloud, but I know of none better than to think on one's true educators.

An incomplete list of people I am grateful to have learned from. Each entry includes some remarks and suggested entry points.

I’ve started writing these mostly for myself, as an exercise in appreciation.

Most entries are brief notes written in minutes, not hours. I’m adding people fairly randomly, when they come to mind and I feel motivated to write about them.

If this exercise proves useful, I will improve the entries.

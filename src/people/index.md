# People
This is a very incomplete list of people I am grateful to have learned from. Each entry includes some remarks and suggested entry points.

Iâ€™m writing these notes mostly for myself, as an exercise in appreciation. I hope they will also enable conversations, serve as useful pointers, and help people give me suggestions for who I should spend time with next.

Warning: most entries are quick notes written in minutes, not hours. 

If this project proves useful, I will improve the entries. You can see the changelog here, and get less than monthly updates by subscribing here. @TODO

I relate to some, but by no means all of these people as exemplars. All of these figures are flawed in many ways, and many hold views I strongly disagree with.

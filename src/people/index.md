# People
This is a very incomplete list of people I am grateful to have learned from. Each entry includes some remarks and suggested entry points.

I’ve started writing these notes mostly for myself, as an exercise in appreciation.

I relate to a few of these people as exemplars. All of these figures are flawed in many ways, and presumably they all hold views I disagree with.

Most entries are quick notes written in minutes, not hours. I’m picking people fairly randomly as I feel motivated to write about them.

If this project proves useful, I will improve the entries.

# Susan Wolf
Susan Wolf is a philosopher who is—like me—troubled by the totalising tendency of impartiality in moral thought. Wolf wants to put the commitment to impartial morality in its place, as one among many important commitments (as opposed to our single most important commitment, that stands above all others in a hierarchy).

Wolf mostly focuses on questions like: what kinds of lives are good lives? What kinds of persons would it be good for ourselves and others to become? 

She points out that while the “impartialist insight” is an essential aspect of moral thought, integrating it into one’s life need not mean letting it absolutely take over. A more moderate interpretation might be: morality requires one to act only in ways that one thinks any reasonable person would allow. Such an interpretation leaves room for a good deal of partiality in one’s psychology and behaviour.

A reform-minded consequentialist might worry that such a moderate formulation is a recipe for complacency and conservatism. Much will hang on how you define the class of “reasonable people”. My sense is that there is a way to read this which leaves plenty of scope for reformist consequentialist agendas, while avoiding the implication that we may only spend time with our loved ones, or pursue personal delights, insofar as this maximises welfare impartially considered, that every aspect of our identity that causes us to deviate from this aim is regrettable. 

Such “moderate impartiality” sees promoting welfare as one among several values that a good person—and a good civilisation—would adopt. In practice, this might mean that we knowingly leave some welfare on the table in order to preserve a tradition, to honour a promise, to express love, to pursue knowledge, to enjoy serenity, to show respect, to make space in which to play. 

Given the way the world is in our time, I can imagine a Singerian figure saying that the idea that we should allow ourselves such luxuries might not be the one most people need to hear right now. I agree that many, perhaps most people should be shifting more towards impartial values in the Singerian sense, but preaching a complete indifference to place, time and identity seems like it could have terrible consequences (so the fully impartial axiology might be wrong as a matter of fact, yet also unhelpful by impartial lights). Ideally we want a message that does both: helps people give impartiality a central place in their value function, while also encouraging them to become who they are.

I have not yet read Wolf’s “Meaning in Life” book, I expect it’s good.

## Notes
* Nietzschean ad hominem: I am suspicious of a psychology that is attracted to the ideal of a moral theory that (in ideal form) simply tells you what to do, issuing commandments for you (or humanity) to selflessly obey. 
* It seems to me that the question of just how much of our “random” identities we admit into our valuing is central. One intuition says something like “we should adapt our value function until it is one that would be endorsed by all rational minds”. I find it hard to take this intuition seriously... it seems like the kind of thought that Williams might describe as “a relic of a world not yet thoroughly disenchanted”.
* Wolf on pluralism
* Pluralism 
* Value convergence seems less important if you have an abundance frame.
	* I’m keen on Greenes idea that we should seek a metamorality that helps different value functions cooperate and co-exist peacefully. Respect for the identity of the other is a crucial ingredient there. Shared recognition that the differences in our identity are somewhat arbitrary and outside our control, that we should double down on our identities yet not exceed our “fair share” (on pain of disastrous warring).
		* This reminds me that I want to read discussion of MAD... superficially, the idea of making war into an option that is clearly a disaster for everyone is pretty interesting as a mechanism for peace... if only you can rely on ppl not to be self-sabbotagingly stupid...
* I’ve not seen Wolf comment on the effective altruism movement. What would I expect her to say? Could she be good for the 80K podcast?
	* I guess she would caution against the hardline Singerian formulation of impartiality, the conception of the good life that implies, and perhaps the lack of emphasis on cultivation of individual virtue. Generally I imagine she’d be fairly supportive. What would she say about longtermism, though? 
		* Have another look at her Parfit essay...
* Bernard Williams
* One might be tempted to see her as occupied with decision procedures rather than criteria of rightness. I think that would be a misreading.

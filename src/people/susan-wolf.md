# Susan Wolf
Susan Wolf is a philosopher who is troubled by the totalising tendency of impartiality in moral thought. Wolf thinks we should regard impartiality as one among many important commitments. We should not think of it as our single most important commitment, that ultimately legitimates everything else we do.

On Wolf’s account, while the “impartialist insight” is an essential aspect of moral thought, integrating it into one’s life need not mean letting it absolutely take over. A more moderate integration might involve recognising that morality requires one to act only in ways that one thinks any reasonable person would allow. Such an interpretation leaves room for a good deal of partiality in one’s grounding commitments.

A reform-minded impartialist might object that such a moderate formulation is a recipe for complacency and conservatism. Much will hang on how you define the class of “reasonable people” and what kinds of commitment you regard as essential to a person’s identity (c.f. [Bernard Williams](/people/bernard-williams.md)). My sense is that there is a way to relate to the impartialist insight which leaves plenty of scope for reformist agendas, while avoiding the implication that we may only spend time with our loved ones, or pursue personal delights, insofar as this maximises welfare impartially considered. 

It strikes me as critical to avoid a view which suggests that every aspect of our particular identity that leads us to deviate from the project of impartial welfare maximisation is regrettable. With Nietzsche, I am suspicious of a psychology that could find such a picture attractive.

“Moderate impartiality” sees an impartial concern for collective welfare as one among several values that a good person—and a good civilisation—would adopt. In practice, this “moderate” stance might mean that we knowingly leave some welfare on the table in order to preserve a tradition, honour a promise, pursue knowledge, enjoy serenity, or to otherwise express our particular values such as they are.

# Susan Wolf
Susan Wolf is a philosopher who is—like me—troubled by the totalising tendency of impartiality in moral thought. Wolf wants to put commitment to impartial morality in its place, as one among many important commitments (as opposed to our single most important commitment, that stands above all others in a hierarchy).

Wolf mostly focuses on questions like: what kinds of lives are good lives? What kinds of persons would it be good for ourselves and others to become? 

She points out that while the “impartialist insight” is an essential aspect of moral though, integrating it into one’s life need not mean letting it absolutely take over. A more moderate interpretation might be: morality requires one to act only in ways that one thinks any reasonable person would allow. Such an interpretation leaves room for a good deal of partiality in one’s psychology and behaviour.

A reform-minded consequentialist might worry that such a formulation is a recipe for complacency and conservatism. Much will hang on how you define the class of “reasonable people”. My sense is that there is a way to read this which leaves plenty of scope for reformist consequentialist thinking, while avoiding the absurd and outrageous implication that I may only spend time with my loved ones or pursue personal delights insofar as this maximises utility.

* [Morality and Partiality](https://sci-hub.tw/https://www.jstor.org/stable/2214247)
* Book: The Variety of Values

I have not yet read Wolf’s “Meaning in Life” book, I expect it’s good.

## Notes
* Wolf on pluralism
* I’ve not seen Wolf comment on the effective altruism movement. What would I expect her to say? Could she be good for the 80K podcast?
* Bernard Williams
* One might be tempted to see her as occupied with decision procedures rather than criteria of rightness. I think that would be a misreading.

Susan Wolf is interesting to compare to [[Tyler Cowen]] and also [[Organize and Publish]] and also [[Matter app notes]].

Susan Wolf is a philosopher who is—like me—troubled by the totalising tendency of impartiality in moral thought. Wolf wants to put moral considerations—particularly those associated with the impartial perspective—in their place: as one among many important commitments (as opposed to our single most important commitment, that legislates on our other commitments).

Wolf mostly focuses on questions like: what kinds of lives are good lives? What kinds of persons would it be good for ourselves and others to become? 

She points out that while the “impartialist insight” is essential, integrating it into ones life need not mean letting it absolutely take over. A more moderate interpretation might be that morality requires one to act only in ways that one thinks any reasonable person would allow. Such an interpretation leaves room for a good deal of partiality in one’s psychology and behaviour.

One might worry that such a formulation is a recipe for complacency and conservatism. Much will hang on how you define the class of “reasonable people”. My sense is that there is a way to read this which leaves plenty of scope for revisionist consequentialist thinking, while avoiding the absurd and outrageous implication that I may only spend time with my loved ones or pursue my passions insofar as this maximises utility.

Places to start:
- [Moral Saints] (introductory discussion by Daniel Calcut)
- [Partiality Impartiality]
- The Variety of Values

I have not read her “Meaning in Life” book, I expect it’s good.

I’ve not seen Wolf comment on the effective altruism movement, but I suspect she would sympathise with my attempt to relate to it as a tool rather than a lifestyle. Insofar as I dedicate resources to ends that are good from the impartial perspective, I want these resources to be deployed in a maximally effective manner. I also do see

One might be tempted to see her as occupied with decision procedures rather than criteria of rightness. But that would be to misread her

 For Wolf, impartiality is a central aspect of the moral perspective, but 

She takes impartiality to be a central aspect of the moral perspective,

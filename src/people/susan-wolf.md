# Susan Wolf
Susan Wolf is troubled by the totalising tendency of impartial concern for welfare in moral thought. Wolf thinks we should regard this concern as one among many important commitments. We should not think of it as our single most important commitment, such that the ideal action is always the one that maximises welfare, impartially considered. 

On Wolf’s account, while the “impartialist insight” is an essential aspect of moral thought, integrating it into one’s life need not mean letting it absolutely take over. A more moderate integration might involve recognising that morality requires one to act only in ways that one thinks any reasonable person would allow. Such an interpretation leaves room for a good deal of unapologetic partiality in one’s grounding commitments.

At this point, a consequentialist point out the difference between a decision procedure (the practical means for an individual to decide) and a criteria of rightness (the things that ultimately determine the moral value of the action). No consequentialist thinks that individuals should always think in terms of maximising welfare every time they face a decision: they should instead think in whatever way leads to the best consequences. Most of the time this will mean relying on rules of thumb and intuitions that make no explicit reference to maximising welfare impartially considered.

A reform-minded impartialist might object that such a moderate formulation is a recipe for complacency and conservatism. Much will hang on how you define the class of “reasonable people” and what kinds of commitment you regard as essential to a person’s identity (c.f. [Bernard Williams](/people/bernard-williams.md)). My sense is that there is a way to relate to the impartialist insight which leaves plenty of scope for reformist agendas, while avoiding the implication that we may only spend time with our loved ones, or pursue personal delights, insofar as this leads to maximum welfare impartially considered. 

With Wolf, I am keen to avoid a view which says that every aspect of our particular identity that distracts us from the project of impartial welfare maximisation is regrettable. With Nietzsche, I am suspicious of a psychology that could find such a picture attractive, or even merely acceptable.

“Moderate impartiality” sees an impartial concern for collective welfare as one among several values that a good person—and a good civilisation—would adopt. In practice, a “moderate” stance might mean that individually and collectively we knowingly leave some welfare on the table in order to preserve a tradition, honour a promise, pursue knowledge, enjoy serenity, or to otherwise express our particular values, such as they are.

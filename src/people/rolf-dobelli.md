# Rolf Dobelli
Reading the news every day makes your understanding of the world worse, not better. 

Several figures helped me realise this, including Tim Harford, David Christian, Hans Rosling, and Nietzsche. For a while I planned to write a polemic essay about this. Then I realised that Dobelli had [already done it](https://www.gwern.net/docs/culture/2010-dobelli.pdf).

Iâ€™ve not read anything else by Dobelli.

# Rolf Dobelli
I developed a fairly strong “daily news is worse than useless” stance in my early twenties, but I spent a year or two knowing this but not really believing it (i.e. doing the work required to break the addiction). Several figures helped me double down (Tim Harford, Hans Rosling and Nietzsche come to mind) but Dobelli’s polemic essay stands out.

I’ve not read anything else by Dobelli.

# Inbound

An experiment in recording what I’m reading, watching, listening to. I’m thinking this might help me be just a bit more selective about what I spend time with. Maybe I can also spot patterns, or extend this to include brief remarks or at least star the best stuff, or something.

Roughly: if I spent more than 5 minutes on it, I’m logging it here.  Seems like a bit of a faff, but if it’s not worth this extra effort, should I really be giving it more than 5 minutes?

I wondered about also logging time spent on Twitter / Hacker News / etc here but it’s too much trouble, I’ll deal with that separately.

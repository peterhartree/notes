# Cheerful axiology
> In some, it is their weaknesses that philosophize; in others, their riches and strengths. The former need their philosophy, be it as a prop, a sedative, medicine, redemption, elevation, or self-alienation; for the latter, it is only a beautiful luxury, in the best case the voluptuousness of a triumphant gratitude that eventually has to inscribe itself in cosmic capital letters on the heaven of concepts.

Axiology is the study of value and disvalue. Once you have an axiological theory, you can (in theory) use it to rank possible worlds from best to worst.

In general, an axiology, plus an accurate picture of the world you find yourself in, can yield the following results:

1. Cheerful: Good to date; good future
2. Future optimism: Bad to date; good future
3. Future pessimism: Good to date; bad future
4. Total disaster: Bad to date; bad future

I really want an axiology that yields result (1). I see this as a grounding commitment—it’s not something I think I (or others) should be persuaded out of. If an axiology does not generate the cheerful picture, I take that as nearly a sufficient reason to reject it.

With Nietzsche, I think this commitment is best understood as an expression of who and what I am. To relax this constraint would be to become a different person, someone who is open to seeing existence as a curse. (In the past, I may have been such a person.)

Nietzsche denies that there is a single correct answer to the question “what is the true axiology?” out there in the world. As I understand him, Nietzsche would say that the world, existence, just is (neutral, indifferent), and we have a choice about how we relate to it. Axiology is a form of self-expression, whether or not we solemnly imagine ourselves as an [[Ideal Observer]]. I tend to agree.

What would be so bad about results (3) and (4)? Total disaster and future pessimism both imply (before you adjust for moral uncertainty) that we should turn off the lights now or soon [1]. The horror of the problem of suffering makes this kind of view somewhat understandable. But… it’s so unattractive. 

If I channel my inner [David Pearce](/people/david-pearce.md), I can worry that “cheerful” breeds catastrophic complacency and conservatism, underplaying the horrors of our present condition, and the urgency of a transition to something better.

I want a hybrid: the cheerfulness of cheerful, plus the urgency that comes from awareness of suffering and lost potential. Bostrom on Astronomical Waste and Letter from Utopia are reasonable attempts at this. And yes, Pearce on abolishing involuntary suffering is good too.

I have a strong intuition that you need to learn to love the present before you develop a radical agenda for the future. Perhaps this is just a view about the conditions for clear sightedness. I would guess that people who do not love the present usually have all sorts of pathologies that mess up their beliefs. But why think this correlation holds in all cases? Probably it doesn’t, but perhaps the correlation is strong enough, and the downsides extreme enough, that a blanket policy of suspicion towards the cheerless makes sense. 

[1] Even if your axiology + empirical beliefs implied total disaster or time to quit, there are several strong reasons not to push a “painlessly destroy life on earth” button, should you come to possess one. One is moral uncertainty, lack of consensus, option value. You might be wrong, and for such a drastic irreversible action, which looks utterly horrendous on other plausible worldviews, you really need to persuade a large % of humanity before you proceed. Another issue is that you ought to ask for a “destroy all possibility of life wherever it’ll clearly be net negative” button. If such buttons are sold out, it might be worth humanity sticking around to develop the technology required to sterilise the universe.

	* Anyway, a bit like David Pearce, I appreciate Tomasik as someone who has dedicated a large chunk of his life to thinking and writing and screaming ([Screamers](/misc/screamers.md)) about the problem of suffering in public. I share the worry that we lucky ones tend towards obliviousness and complacency about the problem that has terrible consequences. Unlike them, I’m a “life lover”, with a strong intuition about the value of [Cheerful axiology](/misc/cheerful-axiology.md).

# Prepare your workspace before you take a break
When I leave my computer to take a break, I arrange my windows and tabs so that on my return I can dive straight into whatever next thing I want to do. This helps me get back up to speed quickly and reduces the risk of getting distracted.

I’ve found this habit surprisingly powerful. I think the main reasons are:

1. During the “What’s next? OK, get setup to work on that” moment I’m particularly at risk of getting distracted by something. Making that process happen when I want/need to take a break means I’m less likely to get sucked in by random triggers.
2. I get back into focussed work faster.
3. I don’t burn “fresh” energy on menial tasks (e.g. opening apps, finding docs)

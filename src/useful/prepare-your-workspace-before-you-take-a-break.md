# Prepare your workspace before you take a break
Before I take a break, I arrange my windows so that I can dive straight into the next thing when I get back. 

I’ve found this habit surprisingly powerful. I think the main reasons are:

1. During the “What’s next? OK, get setup to work on that” moment I’m particularly at risk of getting distracted by something. Making that process happen when I need to take a break means I’m less likely to get sucked in by random triggers.
2. I get back into focussed work more quickly.
3. I don’t burn “fresh” energy on menial tasks (e.g. opening apps, finding docs).

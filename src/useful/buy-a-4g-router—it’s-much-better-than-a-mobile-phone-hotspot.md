# Buy a 4G router—it’s much better than a mobile phone hotspot
For many years, I used a mobile phone hotspot when travelling. 

But it turns out that dedicated hardware—namely a 4G router—will reliably achieve faster connection speeds, mainly due to a better antenna. If the mobile network signal is not great in your location, a router can make video calls possible where a mobile phone would not.

I use a [TP-Link MR 600](https://www.amazon.fr/TP-Link-MR600-Antennes-Amovibles-Op%C3%A9rateur/dp/B07RS7HM59/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=TP-Link+AC1200+4g&qid=1603177691&s=computers&sr=1-2). It’s light (~250g) and the antenna are easily removed, so it’s about the size of a book in your luggage. 

As of 2020: in the UK, Three Mobile has the best roaming data plans. In France, it’s Free Mobile.

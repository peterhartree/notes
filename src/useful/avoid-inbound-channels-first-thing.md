# Avoid inbound channels first thing
Here’s a simple ideal: get up and work on the most important thing for several hours before you check any inbound communication channels. 

How to achieve it:
1. Write your todo list the day before. 
2. Setup an “urgent” communication channel for anyone who might need to reach you before e.g. lunchtime.
3. Each day, refrain from checking (if necessary, block) any of your non-urgent inbound channels before you’ve done a few hours of focussed work.

If deep work is an important part of your role and you are someone who has their best energy at the beginning of the work day, you’re likely to get a large benefit from a setup like this. Here are the main mechanisms:

1. It’ll help maximise the amount of “prime time” you can spend doing deep work on your most important tasks. 
2. It helps you batch process your inbound rather than checking them repeatedly during the day.
3. You’ll feel calmer and happier due to having those first few hours under your control, and, hopefully, emerging from them with a sense of “I did something useful today” even though it’s not even lunchtime yet.

Seriously, try it.

P.S. This workflow is was one of the reasons I made [Inbox When Ready](https://inboxwhenready.org). I often need to retrieve information from my email inbox during these morning work sessions, and I wanted a way to do this without seeing my inbox.

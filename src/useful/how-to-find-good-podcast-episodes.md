# How to find good podcast episodes
In most podcast apps, the “New episodes” list is the easiest way to find things to listen to. This favours novelty and serendipity over quality and relevance. 

I want an app that makes it easy to find the best episodes that are related to what I’m thinking about. Most of the time, I don’t care if the episode was released today or 10 years ago. 

As a starting point I would like an app that lets me:

1. Search by topic or person across all episodes of all podcasts.
2. Select the interesting matches to create a playlist.

I’m yet to find a mobile app that does this well. But  [listennotes.com](http://listennotes.com/)  does enable this. My  [listennotes.com](http://listennotes.com/)  episode discovery pattern looks like this:

1. Search  [listennotes.com](http://listennotes.com/)  for a topic or person of interest.
2. Save the interesting results to my “Listen later” playlist.
3. Listen to episodes from the playlist using my podcast mobile app
	1. The listennotes.com “Listen later” playlists have an RSS feed that you can subscribe to in the usual way with your preferred podcast app.

A similar but less good option: in Podcast Addict you can search across all episodes of all the podcasts you subscribe to.

If you know of an app I might be interested in, please do get in touch.

## Podcast episode curators
The “episode curation” scene is gradually starting to exist. Here are some of the ones I think are good, please tell me about more:

* [The Valmy](https://thevalmy.com) — I run this one!
* [The Syllabus](https://www.the-syllabus.com/)
* [The Podcast Browser](https://www.thepodcastbrowser.com/)

## Other podcast apps of interest
* [Shuffle](https://getshuffle.app/) looks cool, I will try it soon
* [Breaker](https://www.breaker.audio/) is trying to do social podcasting and might be good. I found the app unusable because it auto-downloads the most recent episodes of all 250+ podcasts I subscribe to, and I couldn’t switch this function off.

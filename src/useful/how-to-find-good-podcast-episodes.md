# How to find good podcast episodes
The “New episodes” list is a trap! It favours novelty and serendipity over quality and relevance.

Much of the time, the best thing to listen to is a high quality discussion of a topic that’s already on my mind. It usually doesn’t matter if the episode was released today or 10 years ago. 

## Podcast search
The website [listennotes.com](http://listennotes.com/) is the best podcast search engine I’ve found. You can:

1. Search all episodes of all podcasts for a topic or person of interest.
2. Save interesting results to your “Listen later” playlist.
3. Listen to episodes from the playlist using your favourite podcast app.
_The “Listen later” playlists have an RSS feed that you can subscribe to in the usual way._

An alternative: the Podcast Addict mobile app lets you search across all episodes of all the podcasts you subscribe to.

If you know a good mobile app with a ListenNotes-style search function, please send me a note.

## Curated episode feeds
A small number of people have started publishing curated feeds of their favourite episodes:

* [The Valmy](https://thevalmy.com) — I run this one!
* [The Podcast Browser](https://www.thepodcastbrowser.com/)
* [The Syllabus](https://www.the-syllabus.com/)

I don’t know why more people aren’t doing this.

## Other podcast apps of interest
* [Shuffle](https://getshuffle.app/) seems promising, I’ll try it again in 2021.
* [Breaker](https://www.breaker.audio/) is trying to do social podcasting and might be good one day. I found the app unusable because it auto-downloads the most recent episodes of all 250+ podcasts I subscribe to, and I couldn’t switch this function off.
* [Listennotes.com](https://www.listennotes.com/api/apps/) publishes a list of apps that use its API. Presumably one of these will eventually implement the UI I’m looking for…

# Mac OS: An easy way to dictate instead of type
The Mac OS native dictation tool is good for short messages.

For me, it matches reliably and quickly, and it works on nearly any text field, with the notable exception of Google Docs. If my hands are tired and painful, I find I can use it to write most of my email, Slack messages and Google Doc comments.

How to try it: 
* Double tap the FN key on your laptop’s built-in keyboard. 
* If you’re using an external keyboard, you’ll probably need to change the shortcut. To do that go to System Preferences > Keyboard > Dictation.

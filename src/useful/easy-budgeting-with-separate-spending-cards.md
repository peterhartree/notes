# Easy budgeting with separate spending cards
I have a primary bank account for receiving money (First Direct), and then use two different accounts for day-to-day spending: Monzo (for necessities) and Revolut (for fun). Once a month, I add £XXX to each spending account. 

I like this setup because I mainly just want to know if my monthly / quarterly spending is roughly in line with my budget, and these apps make it easy to get a sense of that. I get a notification for each transaction, which shows me the transaction amount and how much money is left in the account. The notifications also mean I won’t forget about subscriptions I no longer need.

I only use these spending accounts for day-to-day spending. For “big fun” (e.g. pay for holiday) and “big necessity” (e.g. buy car) I use a different credit card and make a separate annual budget.

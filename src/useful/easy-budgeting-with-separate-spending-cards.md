# Easy budgeting with separate spending cards
I have a primary bank account for receiving money, and then two separate accounts for day-to-day spending: Monzo (for necessities) and Revolut (for fun). Once a month, I add £XXX to each spending account. 

I like this setup because I mainly just want to know if my monthly and quarterly spending is roughly in line with my budget. These apps make it easy to get a sense of that. They send a notification for each transaction, which shows the amount and the account balance. 

I only use these accounts for day-to-day spending. For “big fun” (e.g. pay for holiday) and “big necessity” (e.g. buy car) I use a different card and make a separate annual budget.

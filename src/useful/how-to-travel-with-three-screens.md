# How to travel with three screens
I travel a lot, but I’m also the kind of guy who sometimes wants to work with three screens [1]. 

For a couple years, my solution to this was to buy two cheap 24” monitors and carry them around in the central compartment of [this suitcase](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0771STH4V/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), wrapped in a yoga mat. 

This worked fairly well, but the monitors took a lot of space in my luggage, and they’re somewhat heavy. It’s also a bit annoying to faff around with three power plugs (one for each screen, plus one for my laptop) and the relevant UK / EU / US adaptors.

Lately I’ve switched to a much better setup:
* 1x 16” MacBook Pro
* 1x 16” Asus Zenscreen portable monitor (model MB16ACE)
* 1x iPad ([Apple Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210380) lets you use an iPad as a display)

The best thing about this setup is that I easily can fit all three devices in the laptop compartment of my backpack. That’s a huge space saving!! 

The total weight is a couple of kilograms lighter. And the setup requires just one power plug: both the Zenscreen and the iPad draw power from the USB-C ports on my laptop.

The only way this setup is worse than my old one is that the screens are smaller. I thought this might be a problem, but it turns out I don’t actually care about screen size that much: I mainly just want more places to put things. I expect I will buy larger screens when I finally settle in one place for a reasonable duration, but for travel, I’m delighted with this setup.

Also pictured: Logitech K380 keyboard and Logitech M720 mouse. Both are excellent. Both can be paired with the iPad, and you can switch between paired devices with one button press. An iPad plus K380 keyboard makes for a [great writing setup](my-setup-for-writing.md).
 
[1] I find three screens especially useful when coding. One screen is usually better than three for writing.

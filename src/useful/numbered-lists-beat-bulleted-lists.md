# Numbered lists beat bulleted lists
In most communication contexts, a numbered (1, 2, 3) or alphabetical (a, b, c) list is better than a bulleted list:

1. It makes it easy for people to refer to the points you made. 
2. It’ll encourage you to think about the relative priority of the points you’re making.

Most people really underrate point (1). If you make it easy to respond to your points, you will get more responses, and they may be of higher quality.

This is less important in contexts where it’s easy for someone to add a comment to your point (e.g. a Google Doc).

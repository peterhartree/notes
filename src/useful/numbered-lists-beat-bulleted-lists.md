# Numbered lists beat bulleted lists
In most contexts, a numbered (1, 2, 3) or alphabetical (a, b, c) list is better than a bulleted list.

1. It makes it easy for people to refer to the points you made. 
2. It encourages you to think about the priority of the points you’re making.

It’s easy to really underrate point (1). If you make it easy to respond to what you write, you will get more responses, and they may be of higher quality.

This is less important in contexts where it’s easy for someone to add a comment to your text (e.g. a Google Doc).

# My setup for writing
The Apple iPad is surprisingly good as a primary writing device. Some of the more important but less obvious reasons are:

1. It’s a bit of a faff to switch between windows. This makes it easier to stay focussed.
2. If you want to be discreet, you can type on the touchscreen keyboard.
3. The touchscreen keyboard makes you type more slowly, and that is sometimes helpful.
4. You can easily pair a bluetooth keyboard if you want faster typing speed or for longer typing sessions (where you want better ergonomics).
5. If you’re editing, you can also pair a bluetooth mouse.
6. iPad battery life is better than your laptop, and it’s easier to charge with a [portable battery](buy-a-portable-battery.md).
7. You can use the iPad as a second screen for your MacBook ([instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210380)).

Some people recommend using a dedicated device for writing, on the grounds that it helps with focus and establishing a regular writing habit. I have found this to be true. I use the iPad for writing and [focussed reading](my-setup-for-reading-highlighting-and-annotation.md), and I’ve decided not to install any “inbound channel” apps (e.g. email, messaging or social media).

Pen and paper usually doesn’t work for me, but I carry a pocket journal and a black ballpoint in case I need to write someone a note and for the times when I do feel like doing something by hand. 

## Key ingredients
* iPad (7th generation) with Apple smart case
* Logitech K380 bluetooth keyboard
* [ProCase foldable stand](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08CH245V4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [Bear](https://bear.app/) or Google Docs 

## Accessories
* Logitech M780 bluetooth mouse
* [Moleskin pocket journal](https://gb.moleskine.com/cahier-journals-tender-yellow/p1637)
* [Black Bic Crystal Ballpoint pen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bic-Crystal-Ballpoint-Medium-Point/dp/B00903C416?th=1)

## Other options
You could buy an iPad case with built-in keyboard, but they’re much more expensive than the Logitech K380 and seem worse to type on.

I considered an iPad Pro but I’m not sure that the larger screen is worth the slight portability hit. It’s also much more expensive than a regular iPad. The best argument for iPad Pro might be that it supports the 2nd generation Apple Pencil. The first generation Apple Pencil is a pain to charge and doesn’t easily attach to the iPad. For me, this means the faff:usefulness ratio is not good. If I wanted to draw a lot I would consider an iPad Pro. With the regular iPad, I mostly just use my finger, and I’m probably going to sell my Apple Pencil. 

Wirecutter [thinks](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-ipad-is-the-best-tablet/) the iPad is better than other tablets. For writing, the cheapest 32GB wifi-only model is fine.

In the past I used a small 11.6” Chromebook as my primary writing device. It was fine, and might be your best bet if you want a cheaper option or prefer the Google ecosystem.

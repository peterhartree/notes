# Altruism
Altruism is a complicated and somewhat unhelpfully loaded concept. Some issues:

1. It has a “moral purity” association, where complete impartiality and lack of self-interest or partiality is expected, at least in pretence.
	1. Since the boundaries of the self are blurry, 
	2. My anti-realist intuitions suggest that a strong notion of impartial value is incoherent: valuing requires a (partial) valuer.
2. It has a prioritarian, “helping those in need” association. A focus on”prevent bad times” rather than”promote good times”. 
	1. I’m not sure how to compare helping an unhappy person have a slightly less bad time to helping a happy person have a slightly better time, but I am very wary about a perspective that is very strongly focussed on the latter. In some sense, even the most fortunate humans face a somewhat tragic situation, and their lives fall far short of what they might be, for all sorts of reasons. 
3. It carries a “personal sacrifice is good” connotation, which encourages us to focus on levels of sacrifice rather than consequences.

I somewhat regret that the word “altruism” appears in the name of the “effective altruism” movement, though I’m not sure any of the other names on the long list were better ( “super badass do gooders”, anyone?).

The phrase “progress studies” does not have these problems. “Global priorities research” sounds like it ought to be a subset of progress studies.

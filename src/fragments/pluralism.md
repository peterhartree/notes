# Pluralism
My engagement with Nietzsche and other fragments of continental philosophy may have made me unduly pessimistic about the value of theory during my twenties. Yet while I’m trending more optimistic about explicit reasoning, properly contextualised, I remain skeptical that the correct theory of what matters will be simple. 

There may be useful theories of value that are simplifications. But the claim that it all comes down to the pleasure/pain axis... I’m tempted to dismiss this with cries of “physics envy”, though I know I should try harder than that (#todo). Yes, if we reasonably take anything as axiomatic, it might be “extreme involuntary suffering is bad”. But... I think our prior in axiology should be more like our prior in social science: we should expect messy complexity, not fundamental simplicity. I think the weirdness of expecting fundamental simplicity in axiology is a under appreciated, perhaps especially by those who come into moral philosophy with a quantitative background. 

And yes, yes, it’s hard to opine on this without the appearance of pretending to be wise. But really. 

One intimation that this is right: the people who go for the simple theories tend to leave their “singular” value rather broadly or rather vaguely defined.

I sometimes wonder whether, if you really grilled the monists, you’d find that they were presenting a theory they hoped to be a useful simplification, rather than one they put high credence on being true. And just to be clear, I’m all in favour of useful simplifications as a response to complexity, in axiology as in other domains. But we should be very worried about getting blinded to underlying complexity.

# Fragments
Notes to self, writing to think, discover, remember. Usually less than half-baked, often wrong. Mainly of interest to my future self, but maybe of interest to those who wonder how I’m thinking about things. Not suitable for general consumption, not crawled by Google. Comments greatly appreciated.

# Screamers
Listened to Eric Weinstein reading The Nightmare That Is Reality, an essay by Arthur Koestler, published in the New York Times in January 1944. A moment where everyone knew about the holocaust—in the sense that sufficient facts were out there—but most were still in denial, few actually believed. Koestler was one of "the screamers", the people who knew and believed, and who were desperately trying to alert the others. 

Weinstein discusses the phenomenon of knowledge that we do not believe enough to act upon: "I knew everything but I couldn't bring myself to believe it." This deserves a re-listen. #todo

Who are the screamers today? Weinstein suggests (though does not name) Jordan Peterson, as a screamer on behalf of a lost generation of American men (sometimes unfortunately known as the incels). I didn't expect that one—it suggests Weinstein thinks this social group is a graver problem (or an indication of a graver problem) than I've thought. I suppose you might think that these men elected Trump, that they are the product of decades of political failure, the decline of religious community, that the spiral will descend much further, and so on.

If I ask: "who are the screamers today?" I immediately think of the effective altruism and rationality communities. Bostrom on existential risk, Yudkowsky  on AI are the most salient. Singer on animal welfare. Pearce and Tomasik on suffering. Environmental activists. It's almost just "name your favourite important and neglected idea", but it's not quite that: the screamer framing brings out the "nightmare" quality ("there is a terrible truth you don't yet sufficiently realise"), and the response that attempts to downplay / dismiss / deny / not really believe. I've definitely seen this kind of response in others and in myself, but why does it happen? How common is it, really? And what features make it more or less likely? How dysfunctional is it? (False positives are also bad)

	* Anyway, a bit like David Pearce, I appreciate Tomasik as someone who has dedicated a large chunk of his life to thinking and writing and screaming ([Screamers](/fragments/screamers.md)) about the problem of suffering in public. I share the worry that we lucky ones tend towards obliviousness and complacency about the problem that has terrible consequences. Unlike them, I’m a “life lover”, with a strong intuition about the value of [Cheerful axiology](/fragments/cheerful-axiology.md).

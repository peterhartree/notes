# Cheerful axiology
Axiology is the study of value and disvalue. Once you have an axiological theory, you can (in theory) use it to rank possible worlds from best to worst.

An extremely simple axiology might look like this:

* (X) Positive conscious experiences are good

(One might cash out “positive” here by saying something like “if an experiencer could choose between experience X and no experience at all, they would choose X”.)

With (X) defined, we can now rank possible worlds. Let’s say I just have three possible worlds, identical in every respect except that:

* In world (A), I stroke my cat (+1 hedon).
* In world (B), I ignore my cat (0 hedons).
* In world (C), I poke my cat with a stick (-1 hedons).

Axiology (X) says that A > B, which seems correct. But it also says that B = C, which seems wrong. The problem is that (X) is indifferent to negative conscious experiences, which seems wrong. So let’s switch to (Y):

* Positive conscious experiences are good
* Negative conscious experiences are bad

Now we get the desired result: A > B > C. Hurrah!

We can also use axiology to think about whether a life (or an existence) was better than nothing. Let’s imagine that only those events A B C occurred in those worlds. (Y) says that it’s good that world (A) existed, neutral that (B) existed, and bad that © existed.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
So what happens if we apply (Y) to the history of life on earth up to the present?

This is a complicated empirical question, to put it mildly. But it seems possible, perhaps probable, that the number of negative conscious experiences dwarf the number of positive conscious experiences.

If that empirical claim is right, then axiology (Y) implies that if life on earth were to end tomorrow, it would have been better that there was never life on earth. Bummer.

An axiology plus an accurate picture of the world we find ourselves in, can yield the following results:

* Cheerful: Good to date; good future
* Future optimism: Bad to date; good future
* Future pessimism: Good to date; bad future
* Total disaster: Bad to date; bad future

I really want an axiology that yields result (X).

I see this as a grounding commitment—it’s not something I think I (or others) should be persuaded out of. If an axiology does not generate a cheerful picture, I take that as very nearly a sufficient reason to reject it.

I do not take this to be an epistemic commitment, but rather an aesthetic or value commitment, an expression of who / what I am. To relax this constraint would be to become a different person. What kind of person do you want to be? Someone who sees existence as a blessing, or a curse? 

N also struggles with this. In the end, he and I would deny that there is a “right answer” to the question “what is the true axiology?” out there in the world, which if only we were intellectually fearless enough, we could countenance. No, Nietzsche would say that the world, existence, just is (neutral, indifferent), and we have a choice about how we relate to it. It is true that indifference is effectively hostility for life, but whatever, the world provides space for life to strive and flourish, quite the endowment. 

My sense that this question is central might be traced back to suicidal thoughts in my youth. For a while, I did think that pessimism and perhaps suicide was the only appropriate response, that anyone who sees well enough and fearlessly enough would recognise this. But then I started exercising, and read N, and Pippin on N. And realised that mood, orientation, attitude, individual psychology, is such a strong lens, water you swim in but usually do not see. And you can (or at least, I could) change the water, and become a life lover, despite everything, because everything.

What would be so bad about the other results? Total disaster and future pessimism both imply (before you account for moral uncertainty) that we should turn off the lights [1]. Given the problem of suffering, I can sympathise with this kind of view, and I don’t think it’s intellectually obviously wrong. But… it’s so unattractive. 

“Future optimism” is my next best alternative to “cheerful”. I can imagine someone thinking, in the year 3000, that “future optimism” was the more intellectually correct view to hold in 2020, but all the while cutting me some slack for endorsing cheerful. 

I was tempted to say that even if “future optimism” is true, it might be instrumentally better to embrace “cheerful” for now, since it’s easier to live with, or something. But if I channel my inner David Pearce, I would worry that “cheerful” breeds morally catastrophic complacency and conservatism, underplaying the horrors of our present condition (the “Darwinian hellscape” @TODO), and the urgency of navigating to something better.

I want a hybrid: the cheerfulness of cheerful, plus the urgency of awareness of suffering and lost potential. Bostrom on Astronomical Waste and Letter from Utopia are reasonable attempts at this. And yes, Pearce on abolishing involuntary suffering is good too.

I guess I want the urgent energy to not come uniquely from “eradicate the bad” but at least evenly or even predominantly from “promote the good”. 

I also want urgency but not too much urgency. What is too much? On a personal level, it’s becoming monomaniacal, failing to smell the roses. On a civilisational level, it’s incurring unnecessary risk of catastrophic failure, unnecessarily high transition costs.

Why does this matter to me? Well, I’m trying to decide what to advocate for. And though I’m into the transhumanist stuff, I’m also nervous about throwing away some of our hard won achievements by e.g. optimising hard for a too-narrow set of values. 

I have strong intuition that you need to learn to love the present before you develop a radical agenda for the future. Perhaps this is mostly an epistemological / psychological thesis, a view about the conditions for clear sightedness. How strong is this thesis? I would guess that people who do not love the present usually have all sorts of pathologies that mess up their beliefs. But why think this correlation holds in all cases? Probably it doesn’t, but perhaps the correlation is strong enough, and the downsides extreme enough, that pragmatically a blanket policy of suspicion towards the cheerless makes sense. 

[1] As a practical matter, even if your axiology + empirical beliefs implied total disaster or time to quit, there are several strong reasons not to push a “painlessly destroy life on earth” button, should you come to possess one. One is moral uncertainty, lack of consensus, option value. You might be wrong, and for such a drastic irreversible action, which looks utterly horrendous on other plausible worldviews, you really need to persuade a large % of humanity before you proceed. Another issue is that you ought to ask for a “destroy all possibility of life wherever it’ll clearly be net negative” button. If such buttons are sold out, it might be worth humanity sticking around to develop the technology required to sterilise the universe.

# The worst moral theory, except for all the others we’ve tried
Winston Churchill once told the British parliament [1]:

> All this idea of a group of super men and super-planners, such as we see before us, “playing the angel,” as the French call it, and making the masses of the people do what they think is good for them, without any check or correction, is a violation of democracy. Many forms of Government have been tried, and will be tried in this world of sin and woe. No one pretends that democracy is perfect or all-wise. Indeed, it has been said that democracy is the worst form of Government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time […]

Some days, I’m willing to think of pluralistic welfarist consequentialism in a similar way. On rarer occasions, I might say the same about hedonistic consequentialism. Much of the time, I just think: gah, this sucks, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ [2]. 

An alternative take, suggested by David Deutsch, is to consider our conventional moral frameworks as /modes of criticism/ rather than attempts to approximate a fundamental moral truth [3]:

> [Conventional moral frameworks] are all wrong because they are foundationalist. They're all trying to setup a thing from which you can deduce all morality, perhaps only in principle because it's too hard to do the calculation. Are they good approximations? Well I think some are good in some situations but I think they're better regarded not as approximate foundations but as modes of criticism. E.g. utilitarianism I think it's silly to say the foundation of morality is the greatest good for the greatest number, for a start it's circular. [...] But if you're planning to do something that benefits you but harms a lot of people, then utilitarianism is a useful mode of criticism. Same with deontology etc. They all work quite well as modes of criticism but are terrible as foundations.

I’m not sure what to make of this…. I need to read more of Deutsch’s stuff. 

Some people despair at the lack of consensus in moral philosophy. But there are some reasons to be optimistic: there is at least some agreement among most of our least bad theories. And, as Parfit pointed out, the field of non-religious ethics is actually quite young [4].

[2] Luckily, I don’t think you need a clear and settled story about where you want to end up in order to have a view about what a good next step might be. The claim that we should continue our efforts to reduce extreme involuntary suffering seems uncontroversial. The claim that we should put more effort into reducing catastrophic and existential risk (“try to keep the party going, and worth attending”) seems true on all of our least bad moral theories. Our least bad theories disagree on exactly what the relative priorities should be, but there is some significant agreement on what the direction of travel should be.

## Notes
* Based on a quick skim, I think MacAskill, Bykvist and Ord’s [Moral Uncertainty](https://www.moraluncertainty.com/) is not a long way from this in spirit.
* I remember enjoying Jonathan Dancy’s Ethics without Principles during my undergraduate degree, it’s time I went back to that. #todo 
* I really want to spend a couple weeks close reading Parfit.
